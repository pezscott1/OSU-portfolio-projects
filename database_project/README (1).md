This is a project by Scott Dispensa and Tyler Grzymalski. We are creating the database for a large public library that has media consisting of books, music, and movies, which can all be physical or electronic.

A.I. Usage â€“ AI (Microsoft Copilot) was used responsibly as a tool to assist in developing our project. It proved quick and efficient to point out syntax errors or other easily overlooked nuances. Copilot was extremely useful when searching for answers to specific use-cases, i.e., how to create a regex for a phone number to guard against invalid entries, how to properly trim a Date and keep a check-in date prior to today and check-out after check-in, and dealing with debugging around getting at the correct array values when using CALL instead of the function directly.In addition, the syntax for using confirmations of a user action was borrowed from Copilot. Specific uses are cited as comments in-line and at the top of the respective pages. Neither party used AI to assist in generating peer feedback.
